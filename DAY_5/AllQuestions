DAY 5 — OOPs Concepts in Java (Beginner → Intermediate)
🎯 Goal

Understand how Java is structured, not just how it runs.

Solve all 10 questions in Java 👇
(Write separate classes where needed.)

1️⃣ Class & Object

Create a class Student with:

name

rollNo

marks

Create an object and print student details.

2️⃣ Constructor

Add a parameterized constructor to initialize Student details.

3️⃣ Method Overloading

Create a class Calculator with overloaded methods:

add(int a, int b)

add(int a, int b, int c)

add(double a, double b)

4️⃣ Inheritance

Create:

class Animal

class Dog that inherits Animal

Add a method in Animal and override it in Dog.

5️⃣ Polymorphism

Demonstrate runtime polymorphism using method overriding.

6️⃣ Encapsulation

Create a class BankAccount:

private balance

public deposit() and withdraw() methods

Ensure balance cannot be directly accessed.

7️⃣ Abstraction (Abstract Class)

Create an abstract class Shape with method calculateArea().
Implement it in Circle and Rectangle.

8️⃣ Interface

Create an interface Payment with method pay().
Implement it in:

CreditCardPayment

UPIPayment (very India-coded 🇮🇳😉)

9️⃣ this Keyword

Write a program demonstrating use of this keyword to resolve variable conflict.

🔟 static Keyword

Create a class with:

static variable

static method

Show how it is shared across objects.
