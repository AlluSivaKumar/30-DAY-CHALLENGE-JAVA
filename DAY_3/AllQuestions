DAY 3 — Arrays Basics (Beginner → Solid Foundation)
🎯 Goal

Learn to store, traverse, and manipulate arrays confidently.

Solve all 10 questions in Java 👇

1️⃣ Array Input & Output

Input N, then input N integers into an array and print them in the same order.

2️⃣ Find Maximum Element

Find the largest element in an array.

3️⃣ Find Minimum Element

Find the smallest element in an array.

4️⃣ Sum & Average

Calculate the sum and average of array elements.

5️⃣ Count Even & Odd Elements

Count how many even and odd numbers are present in the array.

6️⃣ Search an Element (Linear Search)

Input a number X and check whether it exists in the array.
Print its index if found, else print -1.

7️⃣ Reverse the Array

Reverse the array in-place (don’t use extra array).

8️⃣ Second Largest Element

Find the second largest element in the array.

9️⃣ Check if Array is Sorted

Check whether the array is sorted in ascending order.

🔟 Frequency of Each Element

Print the frequency of each element in the array.
(You may use a nested loop for now — HashMap comes later.)
